# CONTACT-LIST-API
I created this project, Contact List API-based CRUD Operation, to practice API design, server configuration in PHP using .htaccess, and to strengthen my understanding of PHP concepts. This project also allowed me to explore full stack development, incorporating Tailwind CSS for styling and MySQL for database management.
